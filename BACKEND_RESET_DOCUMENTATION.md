# 🚀 Complete Backend Authentication System Reset

## Overview
This document provides complete instructions for resetting and restoring full functionality to the church management application's authentication and user management system.

## ✅ System Reset Completed

### 1. Database Schema Reset
- **✅ Dropped all problematic RLS policies** that caused infinite recursion
- **✅ Recreated clean table structure** with proper relationships
- **✅ Implemented non-recursive RLS policies** using JWT claims
- **✅ Added performance indexes** for optimal query speed

### 2. User Roles Configured
The system now supports 5 distinct user roles with proper permissions:

#### 🔴 **Pastor** (Highest Authority)
- **Access Level:** Full system access
- **Permissions:** All features, user management, financial oversight, system configuration
- **Test Account:** `pastor@amentech.church` / `Pastor123!`

#### 🟠 **Admin** (System Management)
- **Access Level:** Administrative privileges
- **Permissions:** User management, reports, analytics, department management
- **Test Account:** `admin@amentech.church` / `Admin123!`

#### 🟡 **Worker** (Staff Level)
- **Access Level:** Department leadership
- **Permissions:** Task assignment, attendance marking, department reports
- **Test Account:** `worker@amentech.church` / `Worker123!`

#### 🟢 **Member** (Regular Access)
- **Access Level:** Standard member features
- **Permissions:** Personal attendance, events, prayers, announcements
- **Test Account:** `member@amentech.church` / `Member123!`

#### 🔵 **User** (Basic Access)
- **Access Level:** Limited basic features
- **Permissions:** View information, basic interactions
- **Test Account:** `user@amentech.church` / `User123!`

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** → SQL Editor
2. **Copy entire content** from `supabase/migrations/complete_system_reset.sql`
3. **Paste and click "Run"**
4. **Wait for completion** (30-60 seconds)
5. **Verify success** - should see "MIGRATION COMPLETE" message

### Step 2: Create Auth Users
Since Supabase requires auth users to be created through the application, you'll need to:

1. **Go to your application** registration page
2. **Create accounts** for each test role using the emails above
3. **Use the passwords** provided for each role
4. **The system will automatically** link auth users to the pre-created profiles

### Step 3: Verify System Functionality

#### Test Login for Each Role:
```bash
# Pastor Login Test
Email: pastor@amentech.church
Password: Pastor123!
Expected: Full dashboard access, all menu items visible

# Admin Login Test  
Email: admin@amentech.church
Password: Admin123!
Expected: Admin dashboard, user management, reports

# Worker Login Test
Email: worker@amentech.church  
Password: Worker123!
Expected: Department features, task management

# Member Login Test
Email: member@amentech.church
Password: Member123!
Expected: Basic member features, events, prayers

# User Login Test
Email: user@amentech.church
Password: User123!
Expected: Limited access, basic information
```

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **✅ Non-recursive policies** prevent infinite loops
- **✅ JWT-based role checking** avoids database recursion
- **✅ User isolation** - users can only access their own data
- **✅ Role-based permissions** enforced at database level

### Authentication Flow
- **✅ Secure password hashing** via Supabase Auth
- **✅ Session management** with automatic refresh
- **✅ Role-based route protection** in frontend
- **✅ Proper error handling** and validation

### Data Protection
- **✅ Email uniqueness** enforced
- **✅ Role validation** with database constraints
- **✅ Audit trail** with created_at timestamps
- **✅ Soft delete** capabilities where needed

## 📊 Database Structure

### Core Tables Created:
1. **users** - User profiles and authentication data
2. **departments** - Church departments and ministries  
3. **user_departments** - User-department assignments
4. **tasks** - Task management system
5. **attendance** - Attendance tracking
6. **finance_records** - Financial transactions (Pastor/Admin only)
7. **notifications** - User notifications
8. **notes** - Personal notes system
9. **church_settings** - Church configuration

### Default Data Inserted:
- **8 Church Departments** (Worship, Youth, Children, etc.)
- **Church Settings** with AMEN TECH branding
- **Test User Profiles** for all 5 roles

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Authentication Tests
- [ ] Pastor can log in and access all features
- [ ] Admin can log in and manage users
- [ ] Worker can log in and manage department
- [ ] Member can log in and access member features
- [ ] User can log in with basic access
- [ ] Invalid credentials are rejected
- [ ] Logout functionality works for all roles

### ✅ Permission Tests
- [ ] Pastor can create/edit/delete users
- [ ] Admin can manage departments and reports
- [ ] Worker can assign tasks and mark attendance
- [ ] Member can view events and submit prayers
- [ ] User has limited read-only access
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts are blocked

### ✅ Data Security Tests
- [ ] Users can only see their own personal data
- [ ] Role-based data access is enforced
- [ ] Financial data is restricted to Pastor/Admin
- [ ] RLS policies prevent data leakage
- [ ] No infinite recursion errors occur

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### "Policy already exists" Error
```sql
-- Run this to clean up:
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "policy_name" ON table_name;
-- Then re-run the migration
```

#### "Infinite recursion" Error
- **Fixed:** New policies use JWT claims instead of table queries
- **Prevention:** Never reference the same table in policy conditions

#### Login Issues
1. **Check user exists** in both `auth.users` and `public.users`
2. **Verify email confirmation** status
3. **Check role assignment** is correct
4. **Test with different browser** or incognito mode

#### Permission Issues
1. **Verify RLS policies** are active
2. **Check JWT token** contains correct role
3. **Test role-specific features** individually
4. **Review browser console** for detailed errors
